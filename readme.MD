Reason      :
    Fix You

    The world is a scary place. I know it because I've been living in it. I've been through some of the highest highs and lowest lows and I can tell you, it is scary. If you mess up hard enough, you may easily find yourself on the street.  

    I found my calling though. I've been wanting to help people since I was born.  I wanted to study medicine, become a doctor, and help people with their health. Eventually realized that the career was not right for me, but that's a different story. 

    After working and living near the Tendernob in SF, I've talked to a number of homeless people I wish I could have helped more than giving them however much I had in my pocket.  I've given some $40, $20, $5... It's pretty much all I can afford these days.  Sometimes I'll take them to get food (Jack in the Box is near by and there's pizza places) and quiz them on how they ended up on the streets.  It's painful and I wish I could do more.

    It's not only the homeless though.  It's the lower and middle classes that are getting torn up in this economy as well.  It's students.  It's the stagnant wages.  It's the increasing cost of everything.  It's the economy, stupid.  We have a system where it is designed to be difficult at the bottom of the food chain.

    The fix, based on my casual studies into basic income and studies in Africa that gave money directly to African families, is to create a way to give money to people without a need for time based reciprocation.   

    The Base Income Organization (BIO) gives the world an entirely new way to give money to those in need directly and transparently.  Donations will be given evenly and directly to people who are verified.

    BIO will be aimed at not just giving money to the homeless or the extremely impoverished, but ultimately to have a safety net / replacement / supplement of income for $XX,XXXX a year for anyone who signs up and has a verified identity on the site and makes less than an amount.  This will make a huge difference -- if we can give $500-1000 a month recurring for a year to 1,000 people, it would completely change their world.  With a stable income, they can focus on what is most important to getting back up on their feet.

    More details will be coming soon, but for now what I need to know is if there are people and businesses out there who want to see this happen.

    If you would be interested in making a one time or recurring donation, please sign up.

How It Works

    There will be a score for priority of need/assistance for each person based on income, etc.  After talking with a number of homeless in the San Francisco Tenderloin area about this idea, I started to prioritize people in need pretty quickly. 

    For qualifying a receiver, we would deconstruct a few things -- a pregnant female may warrant a higher priority than a drugged out older male.  Sometimes a young and newly homeless person who is just caught in the wrong place at the wrong time could use money and would be a priority -- they would need less cash and could get back on their feet more easily because they are closer to society after being recently expelled from it.
    
    There have been [many articles lately about basic income](find citation on basic income) and [how giving money to people directly is awesome](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/25/240590433/what-happens-when-you-just-give-money-to-poor-people).  For example, GiveDirectly.org enables users to give funds directly to African families, while [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/) let's you make microloans to people in several countries worldwide.  There's also [YouCaring](http://www.youcaring.com/) that gives you the ability to give money for medical expenses, which is awesome as well.

    Less desirable is giving money to a druggy or gambler and then giving someone who you know is in need.  Abuses of the system are unfortunate and we will not encourage it.  There are a few solutions that I have in mind to remove risk of giving to those people, but the ultimate goal is to get them back on their feet and it may be that we monitor their spending closely or allow for reporting of abuses.

    Distributions will be equal amongst everyone in the pool.  Everything will be done in a transparent way.
