BIO Donor Email

Hello,

Thanks for signing up.  I believe basic income in practice is possible.  I don't believe in waiting for the government to take action.  This is something that needs to happen before it's too late.

People today are losing jobs that are simply not going to be replaced anytime soon.  This is going to happen a lot.  I believe that with direct intervention we can undo the unbalancing caused to the economy.  If you think about the current flow of money in our economy, it's obviously slanted towards one direction.  My goal for BIO is to create a two way street for wealth by giving them and businesses the ability to give directly to people without having to employ or give to them on the street.  Ideally, this will create a positive feedback loop within the economy where money can flow from the top down and back to the top again.

I'm currently working on this in my spare time.  There's lots of hurdles to go through in starting a non-profit organization.  However, I would like to know more about you.  

First, what's your name?  And if you're representing a business, which business are you representing?

Dave
